## Abstract
Health insurance pays for some or all the cost of the health services you receive, like doctorsâ€™ visits, hospital stays, and visits to the emergency room. It helps keep your health care costs predictable and affordable. Although being covered by your insurance, you may still have to pay amounts for health insurance, such as premium. In this report, I will analyze how the insurance charges are affected by other factors.
